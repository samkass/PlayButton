PlayButton
==========

PlayButton was designed at the extreme end of simplicity for audio recording 
and playback functionality on iOS. It includes a single, large play button that
plays back a sound. The sound is whatever was recorded by the small record button
in the corner (which can also be toggled off in the Settings, to prevent accidental
re-recording.)

The large play button was designed to be
accessible for anyone, including those with reduced motor control. Besides being
fun, it is useful as a way to allow everyone to be included in music therapy, special
education, and early childhood development. Enjoy.

This code is being distributed under the GNU GPL 3.0, which allows you to use it as you
see fit for your personal use, and redistribute the code as per its terms, but does not
allow you to build and submit this app to the iOS App Store. However, copying and pasting 
small code snippets out of examples like these, or using this code as a learning tool, 
I consider fair use, and not bound by any
Copyright agreement. This app is a pretty good example of setting up a simple record
AVAudioRecorder and AVAudioPlayer and connecting them to a UI, so I hope you find it useful.
