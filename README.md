PlayButton
==========

PlayButton was designed at the extreme end of simplicity for audio recording 
and playback functionality on iOS. The extreme large play button was design to be
accessible for anyone, including those with reduced motor control. Besides being
fun, it is useful as a way to allow everyone to be included in music therapy, special
education, and early childhood development. Enjoy.

Although the Copyright is currently restrictive for outright duplication, please use 
this source code as a learning tool for simple audio capture and playback for iOS.
Copying and pasting specific function calls out of examples like these, I consider fair use.
